# Daala tools #

This is a standalone repo that splits out (some of) the tools from
[Daala](https://github.com/xiph/daala).

At the moment, the following tools are split out:

- `dump_psnrhvs`
- `dump_psnr`
- `dump_ssim`&#151;added `-p` (per-frame parallelism) and `-l` (max # frames) switch
- `dump_fastssim`
- `png2y4m`&#151;added `-d` and `-i` switches
- `y4m2png`

You can find some build instructions in the [mu repository](https://github.com/excamera/mu).
